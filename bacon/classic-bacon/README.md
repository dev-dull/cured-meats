## Classic Bacon
Based on the [recepie from Chud's BBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z19z5TNXf1o), but you were too lazy (read: stressed out from job interviewing) to calculate the exact ratios from his video, so you asked Perplexity for some sane percentages.

You used maple sugar instead of white sugar
You didn't have red pepper flake, so you did ~2/5ths chipotle powder and ~3/5ths paprika

- You took recommendations to soak the cured pork belly after rinsing but before smoking. You soaked for 20min which worked, but is still vaguely on the salty side. Next time, less salt (so, 2%) and less soaking.
- If you continue to use maple sugar, maybe bump up the percentage by 0.25% at a time.
- Next time, increase the pepper amount
- the subs for crushed red pepper ended up similar, but certainly stick with crushed red pepper whenever possible.

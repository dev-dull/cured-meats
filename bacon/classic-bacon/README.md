## Classic Bacon
Based on the [recepie from Chud's BBQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z19z5TNXf1o), but you were too lazy (read: stressed out from job interviewing) to calculate the exact ratios from his video, so you asked Perplexity for some sane percentages.

You used maple sugar instead of white sugar
You didn't have red pepper flake, so you did ~2/5ths chipotle powder and ~3/5ths paprika

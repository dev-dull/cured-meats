## Salmon
I used bacon ratios as a starting point. It ended up too bland, but I think the issue was that you didn't let the cure/rub sit long enough (only about 12hrs) before rinsing and smoking.

Consider adding a water pan to the smoker to dial up the smoke flavor.

You cooked to ~140Â°F but after freezing/vac-seal/reheating its dry.

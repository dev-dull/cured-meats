## Spicy Italian
Edit value for, `pork_weight`. Based on the [How to Make Cheesy Italian Sausage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUSfoC3H8Kk) from Chud's BBQ.

Notes from the most recent cook:
- You ran out of fennel and you subbed in caraway seed. it ended up about 2/3 fennel and 1/3 caraway.
- Chud's used fennel powder, but you toasted all the dry seed-like ingredients (fennel, caraway, black pepper seed, coriander) and blitzed it in a whirly blade grinder. Danielle likes the sausage, but didn't like the smell in the house after toasting everything (it smelled like someone trying to reinvent curry through guessing)
- You had plenty of fresh garlic from the farmers' market, so you used ~3 cloves (which you ran through the grinder with the meat) and dialed back the powdered garlic.
- You added onion powder because, imo, it's weird to add garlic and not onion.
- You ran out of crushed red pepper flakes, so you used about 3/4 of the amount called for, but the sausage still has plenty of a kick.
- You went easy on the sugar, but only by a gram or two.
- You ran out of paprika and subbed in chipotle powder. It ended up being about 2/3 and 1/3 of each.
- You skipped the tumeric entirely since, imo, it doesn't bring any flavor to the party and _maybe_ it gives you stomach problems?
- Dried parsley smells like dog food, so you used fresh. Also, you like the look of the green in teh sausage. The goal was 3x the weight of dry, but you ran slightly short of that. You ran the leaves through the grinder with the meat. Next time, do a course chop first.
- Chud's uses tomato sauce as his liquid, but I felt it would make the sausage taste too much like pizza, so you mostly used water plus a little chicken broth that needed to get used.
- You cold smoked the sausage using hickory pellets with a water pan on top of the smoke tube (the water pan seems like it worked well for the andouille) and then cooked them to an internal temp of 155Â°F. Similar to the andouille, the hickory pellets were stronger than some people would enjoy.

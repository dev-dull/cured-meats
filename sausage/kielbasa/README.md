## Kielbasa
prompts you for weight. Probably needs to be updated to correctly calculate cure for meat+seasoning instead of just meat (see andouille for this).

You had made a HUGE batch for sharing. It was fine, but something came out odd about it (too salty?). Additionally, the casing ended up pretty chewy and I think maybe the casing hadn't dried enough before drying???

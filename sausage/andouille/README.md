## Andouille
Edit value for, `pork_weight`. Mostly based on [Age Of Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNLlvlCjYzs) recipe.

I got multiple unsolicited complements from multiple people and I had done the following modifications:
- Ground with the largest hole plate I had (the largest plate that comes with the Kitchenaid stand mixer grinder)
- You didn't have any cheyenne, so you used smoked paprika. It was fine, but needed more heat. 50/50 next time?
- You didn't buy quite enough fresh thyme. It was fine, but did need more.
- You used "Estate Grown Stone Cap Chardonnay 2022 Columbia Valley" from "Goose Ridge Vineyards" (bar code: 85913900011) for the white wine.
- 10% (by weight) was diced into ~1cm cubes to try to be somewhat traditional. **Next time, do 15%.** to get a more traditional texture. Dice it  and mix it in semi-frozen.
- I did a cold smoke using hickory pellets in a smoke tube and a pan of water sitting on top of the smoke tube. The combo was put under the drip pan plate of the Traeger grill. I got way, WAY more smoke flavor than a smoke tube alone. The hickory was strong and well liked, but at least one person took a slice and put the rest back, so maybe cherry, apple ... something milder next time.
- After the cold smoke, I fired up the grill to 250Â°F and smoked until the sausage reached 155Â°F and then dumped it into the ice bath until the internal temp stopped climbing.
- You used jarred minced garlic with the assumption that, "A typical head (bulb) of garlic usually weighs between about 40 to 90 grams..." Consider dialing up the garlic.

fwiw, you followed the recommendation that a smaller horn on the stuffer will give you more control, but you ended up with so, SO many air pockets in the sausage.

I anticipated that the sausage would get cut up and thrown into the crayfish boil, but they wanted it whole ðŸŽ‰, so next time, instead of trying to be traditional with 12in links, do stubby 4-6in links.
